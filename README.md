---

This repository showcases a collection of problem sets that I've tackled in the domain of time series analysis. Through these exercises, I've gained invaluable insights into the intricacies of modeling time-dependent data and refined my skills in various statistical methodologies and techniques.

## Skills and Insights Gained:

### 1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
- Managed and cleaned raw data, ensuring removal of missing entries.
- Transformed data to prepare for time series modeling.

### 2. **Regression Modeling**
- Applied linear regression to model trends over time.
- Explored higher-order polynomial fits (quadratic and quartic) to better capture data nuances.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### 3. **Time Series Decomposition**
- Identified and accounted for seasonality in time series data.
- Implemented adjustments to the model to accommodate seasonal variations.

### 4. **ARIMA and AR Models**
- Utilized Autoregressive (AR) models to forecast future data points based on its own past values.
- Explored the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to capture different components of the time series.
  
### 5. **Model Optimization**
- Optimized ARIMA parameters and seasonal parameters for improved forecasting with the SARIMAX model.
- Applied regular model evaluations to prevent overfitting and enhance model robustness.

### 6. **Advanced Time Series Techniques**
- Implemented SARIMAX, an extension of ARIMA, to incorporate external regressors.
- Evaluated how different aggregation methods for regressors (e.g., monthly averages versus monthly first values) influence model outcomes.

### 7. **Moving Average (MA) Models**
- Delved into MA models where forecasts are based on a linear combination of past white noise error terms.
- Evaluated the auto-covariance of an MA(1) model.

### 8. **Understanding and Application of Statistical Concepts**
- Engaged deeply with concepts like auto-covariance, stationary conditions, and the equivalence between AR and MA models.
  
### 9. **Tools and Programming**
- Employed Python as the primary tool for data processing, visualization, and modeling.
- Leveraged Python libraries like SARIMAX for sophisticated model fitting and forecasting.

## Conclusion:

The journey through these problem sets has provided a robust foundation in time series analysis. Each problem tackled not only honed my technical skills but also refined my approach towards data-driven decision-making, ensuring that insights derived are both statistically sound and contextually relevant.
